              Have you ever heard about "Port"? What does Port Wine Taste
              Like?</strong
            >
            <br />
            Port is a sweet wine with flavors of raspberry, blackberry, caramel,
            cinnamon, and chocolate sauce. Sound delicious? It is! There are
            several styles of port, but the 2 major styles of Port include a red
            Port with more berry and chocolate flavors (and slightly less
            sweetness), and a tawny-colored Port with more caramel and nut
            flavors (and more sweetness). Older, fine Tawny Ports have an even
            wider array of subtle flavors including graphite, green peppercorn,
            hazelnut, almond, butterscotch, and graham cracker. Look for wines
            aged for 30 or more years for this level of complexity!
